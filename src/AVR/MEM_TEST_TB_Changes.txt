 9: LD    R7, X
X = 0
Maps to Register 0
R7 now contains $AAAA (from Register 0)

12: LD    R21, X
X = 0 (decremented and then incremented)
Maps to Register 0
R21 now contains $AAAA (from Register 0)

14: LD    R23, Y
Y = 0 (got incremented once from FFFF)
Maps to Register 0
R23 now contains $AAAA (from Register 0)

16: LDD   R15, Y + 30
Y = FFFF
Y + 30 = 29 (decimal)
R29 contains FF (from third instruction)
R15 now contains FF (from R29)

44: ST    X, R26
X = 0
Maps to Register 0
R26 contains FF
R0 now contains FF (from R26)
(shouldn't write, and should not check address bus)

45: ST    Y+, R21
R21 is last changed in instruction 12 (LD    R21, X)
X = 0, so this came from register 0, instead of memory
Register 0 was set to 32 in instruction 7 (LDS   R0, $AAAA)

46: ST    Y, R23
R23 is last changed in instruction 14 (LD    R23, Y)
Y = 0, so this came from register 0, instead of memory
Register 0 was set to 32 in instruction 7 (LDS   R0, $AAAA)

51: STD   Y + 22, R15
R23 is last changed in instruction 16 (LDD   R15, Y + 30), where it was set to
FF, because it came from R29, rather than memory.

53: ST    Z+, R14
R14 is last changed in instruction 24 (MOV   R14, R7)
R7 is last changed in instruction 9 (LD    R7, X)
X = 0 during this instruction, so R7 was set to 32 (from R0), instead of what
was on the data bus
